# PasswordGenerator
Random Password Generator

## Development

Was given pre-existing code with an EvenListener coded to run function writePassword on click. 

Began by creating a repo in gitHub and pushing all existing files and directories. Edited some basic styling CSS.

Then began working with script.js. Began by defining functions to allow user to select whether they would like to include UpperCase, Numbers, and Special Charaters to password they are generating. This was done using the ASCII chart for the alphabet strings and numbers, and a normal string was used for special characters.
